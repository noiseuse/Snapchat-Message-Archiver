#Snapchat Message Archiver

With this tool one can output a .txt file containing all saved messages between them and any other Snapchat friend. 

#How to Get Data File

The following steps were taken from  https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-gb/articles/7012305371156 
1. Log into your account on accounts.snapchat.com
2. Click "My Data".
3. Click "Submit Request" at the bottom of the page.
4. Enter a valid email address and we’ll send you an email with a link once your data is ready to download. Please don’t share this link with anyone.
5. Follow the link in your email to download your data.
6. Click the link to download your data.

After this, you will have access to a .json file containing Snapchat message data. You may rename this file to whatever you like, and then use this same file for this code. 

#How to Use the Archiver

Once the repository is downloaded and the .json file is in the same directory as the code, run the code. The code will ask for the name of the .json file. Enter the name of the .json file, then the name desired title of your document, the name of the friend you want to archive, and finally yours. The code will output a .txt file containing all messages between you and that friend which can be then input into a word document or transfered to pdf format.
